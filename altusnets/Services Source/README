NOT FISABLE TO STOP SNAPSHOT/LOGGING ABOVE DATA WHILE PLANNING/RENDERING A AUTOMATION SOLUTION FOR ABOVE DATA BANK/LEDGER.

Update for 2020-07-24-04-44-GMT;

Will continue offloading DATA to on-site storage only due to extrapolating
conditions.

Frequency of DATA snapshots will increase to maximum(humanely possible)until automation approved by myself(ie. can engineer the software to automate DATA points/blocks, not possible while rendering logging of the DATA), also working the DATA in addition to my other working proofs(ie. my physics, chemistry and computer science occupation), and daily life transcriptions, and at randomized time frames.

NOTE:we will use the term "flux" as the defining term that depicts full spatial rendering in quantum; processor architecture/computing(ie. the median-free liquid-filled full-spatial photonic BIT transfer processor/computer for true syncronys timed events).

Current uploaded files time in seconds on device 
capture times are recorded at the time of icon 
click. 

Note:To record a matched time sync on silica system's, time must be 
pre-registered programmatically, not true time synchronization(ie. time sync incomplete).

*important note:a silicon semiconductor 
microprocessor and/or any like graphene structured 
conductor are materially incapable of synchronized 
derivative matching due to electron flow in 
structurally finite crystallization pattern
(ie. route capability), only light at all it's 
frequencies(ie. RGB pattern) in a meadin free(ie. unified flowing plane) 
viscous plankton vacuum(ie. sealed free flowing unit) is synchronous true for 
timing events(ie. time sync complete).

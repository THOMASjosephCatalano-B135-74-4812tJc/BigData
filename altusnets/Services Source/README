NOTE:we will use the term "flux" as the defining term that depicts full spatial rendering in quantum; processor architecture/computing(ie. the median-free liquid-filled full-spatial photonic BIT transfer processor/computer for true syncronys timed events).

Current uploaded files time in seconds on device 
capture times are recorded at the time of icon 
click. 

Note:To record a matched time sync on silica system's, time must be 
pre-registered programmatically, not true time synchronization(ie. time sync incomplete).

*important note:a silca semiconductor 
microprocessor and/or any like graphene structured 
conductor are materially incapable of synchronized 
derivative matching due to electron flow in 
structurally finite crystallization pattern
(ie. route capability), only light at all it's 
frequencies(ie. RGB pattern) in a meadin free(ie. unified flowing plane) 
viscous plankton vacuum(ie. sealed free flowing unit) is synchronous true for 
timing events(ie. time sync complete).

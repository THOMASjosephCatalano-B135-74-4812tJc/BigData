Update for 2020.07.24-04:44GMT;

Will continue offloading DATA to on-site storage only due to extrapolating
conditions.

Frequency of DATA snapshots will increase to maximum(humanely possible)until automation approved by myself while also working the DATA in addition to my other working proofs(ie. my physics, chemistry and computer science occupation), and daily life transcriptions, and at randomized time frames.

*missed snapshot.

Update for 2020.07.18-18:14GMT;

from 2020.07.17GMT;
https://outlook.live.com was only browser window to require multi refresh at the time, not cause of multi-window browser shutdown.

Update for 2020.07.18-18:00GMT;

multi-browser shutdown, hard stored removal of Exchange(MSN) embedded application required, was not approved for installation on device, required down time not available at this time.

Update for 2020.07.18-15:21GMT;

NOTE:we will use the term "flux" as the defining term that depicts full spatial rendering in quantum; processor architecture/computing(ie. the median-free liquid-filled full-spatial photonic BIT transfer processor/computer for true syncronys timed events).

Update for 2020.07.17-00:15GMT;

Current uploaded files time in seconds on device 
capture times are recorded at the time of icon 
click. 

Note:To record a matched time sync on silica system's, time must be 
pre-registered programmatically, not true time synchronization(ie. time sync incomplete).

*important note:a silicon semiconductor 
microprocessor and/or any like graphene structured 
conductor are materially incapable of synchronized 
derivative matching due to electron flow in 
structurally finite crystallization pattern
(ie. route capability), only light at all it's 
frequencies(ie. RGB pattern) in a meadin free(ie. unified flowing plane) 
viscous plankton vacuum(ie. sealed free flowing unit) is synchronous true for 
timing events(ie. time sync complete).

Update for 2020.07.16-20:08GMT;

Added www.usno.navy.mil to master time clock 
for master ntp and ntppool date_time check.

Update for 2020.07.16-20:07GMT;

www.time.gov loading with-in five to six seconds
of normal load/refresh rate.

Update for 2020.07.16-19:56GMT;

www.time.gov not loading.

Update for 2020.07.15-10:10GMT;

Uploading restored, continuing data uploading to https://github.com/altusnets/BigData/altusnets/Services Source/*, 
and off site storage.

Update for 2020.07.15-09:27GMT;

Upload interruption to https://github.com/altusnets/BigData/altusnets/Services Source/*, 
continuing data collection and entries(as per inclusive directories
context) on local off site storage.

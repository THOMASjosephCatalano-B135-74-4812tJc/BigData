Current uploaded files time in seconds on device capture times
are recorded at the time of icon click. To record 
matched zero(0) time must slightly pre-register 
display clock timer.

*important note:a semiconductor(silca based 
microprocessor) and/or any like graphene structured conductor are 
materially incapable of synchronise derivative matching due to 
electron flow in structurally finite crystallization pattern(
ie. route capability) only light at all it's frequencies(ie. RGB pattern)
in a meadin free viscous vacuum is sum correct for timed events(ie. synchronization).
